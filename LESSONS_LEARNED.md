# Lessons Learned — Draft Dodger on Agent 365

A categorized post-mortem of every non-obvious thing we hit while building this agent. Each entry: **Symptom · Root cause · Fix · Why it matters**. If you're following [`SETUP.md`](SETUP.md) and something looks broken, this is the document to skim first.

> Context: build was on macOS (Darwin 25), Azure AI Foundry project, gpt-5.4-nano deployment. Tenant + tunnel + blueprint identifiers redacted — substitute your own. SDK versions cited are the ones that bit us; newer versions may have moved.

## 1. Foundry Responses API endpoint quirks

### 1.1 Wrong audience → 401 Unauthorized

- **Symptom:** `401 - {"message":"Unauthorized. Access token is missing, invalid, audience is incorrect (https://ai.azure.com), or have expired."}`
- **Root cause:** Token was minted for audience `https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default` (the classic Azure OpenAI audience). Foundry projects endpoints use a different audience.
- **Fix:** Request the token with `https://ai.azure.com/.default` instead. In `agent.py`:
  ```python
  cred.get_token("https://ai.azure.com/.default")
  ```
- **Why it matters:** This is invisible in any docs you'll find by Googling "Azure OpenAI authentication" — those all say `cognitiveservices`. Foundry uses a different audience and the error message is the only hint.

### 1.2 `base_url` must end in `/openai/v1/`

- **Symptom:** Random 404s and routing failures when constructing the SDK client.
- **Root cause:** The SDK appends `/responses`, `/chat/completions`, etc., onto whatever `base_url` you pass. If your `base_url` doesn't end in `/openai/v1/`, the URL it builds is wrong.
- **Fix:** Set the env var precisely:
  ```
  AZURE_OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>/openai/v1/
  ```
- **Why it matters:** It looks like the URL we'd write by hand, but the trailing slash and the literal `/openai/v1/` segment matter.

### 1.3 The `/v1/` path rejects `?api-version=…`

- **Symptom:** `400 - api-version query parameter is not allowed when using /v1 path`
- **Root cause:** `AzureOpenAIResponsesClient` (from `agent_framework.azure`) hardcodes `?api-version=preview` on every request. The Foundry `/v1/` path is OpenAI-compatible, not classic Azure-OpenAI, and rejects that query parameter.
- **Fix:** Don't use `AzureOpenAIResponsesClient`. Use raw `openai.AsyncOpenAI` with `base_url` instead. See lesson 2.1.
- **Why it matters:** This kills the most "obvious" SDK choice. You can spend an hour wondering why the SDK is broken before realizing the path itself is incompatible with the SDK's URL builder.

---

## 2. `agent_framework` SDK bugs we hit (build `1.0.0b260130`)

### 2.1 `OpenAIResponsesClient` sends malformed `input[1]`

- **Symptom:** `400 - {"error":{"message":"Invalid value: ''. Supported values are: 'apply_patch_call', 'message', 'reasoning', ..."}, "param":"input[1]"}`
- **Root cause:** The framework client serializes the system prompt as a separate `input[0]` and the user message as `input[1]`, but `input[1]`'s `type` field is empty in the request body. The Responses API expects every input array item to have a non-empty `type` (`"message"`, `"reasoning"`, etc.).
- **Fix:** Bypass `agent_framework.ChatAgent` entirely. Call `openai.AsyncOpenAI.responses.create(...)` directly:
  ```python
  response = await client.responses.create(
      model=deployment,
      instructions=AGENT_PROMPT,
      input=user_message,
  )
  ```
  We lose `ChatAgent`'s middleware/tool plumbing, but we explicitly chose no MCP servers, so nothing of value was lost. The `AgentInterface` contract (`process_user_message`, `cleanup`, `initialize`) didn't change, so `host_agent_server.py` doesn't notice.
- **Why it matters:** The framework's "Responses API" client is silently broken against actual Foundry endpoints. Direct SDK usage is the workaround. When the framework fixes it, swap back.

### 2.2 `AzureOpenAIResponsesClient` hardcodes `api_version=preview`

See lesson 1.3. Same root: framework code is built for the deployment-style URL pattern, not the OpenAI-compatible `/v1/` style.

---

## 3. OpenAI Python SDK 2.34.0 credential gotcha

- **Symptom:** `OpenAIError: Missing credentials. Please pass an api_key, workload_identity, admin_api_key, or set the OPENAI_API_KEY or OPENAI_ADMIN_KEY environment variable.`
- **Root cause:** When you build an `AsyncOpenAI` client with `base_url` (the OpenAI-compatible path mode), the underlying base class enforces `api_key` at constructor time, even if you also pass `azure_ad_token_provider`. The Azure-aware logic that bridges `azure_ad_token_provider` → `api_key` doesn't kick in until later.
- **Fix:** Pass an **async callable** as `api_key` that returns the bearer token. The SDK calls this on every request to refresh the token:
  ```python
  cred = AzureCliCredential()

  async def get_bearer_token() -> str:
      return cred.get_token("https://ai.azure.com/.default").token

  client = AsyncOpenAI(base_url=base_url, api_key=get_bearer_token)
  ```
  Synchronous callables fail with `TypeError: object str can't be used in 'await' expression` — the SDK awaits the result.
- **Why it matters:** This is the working pattern for Entra ID auth against the `/v1/` Foundry path. None of the obvious approaches (`workload_identity`, `azure_ad_token`, `azure_ad_token_provider` alone, dummy `api_key="x"`) will all work cleanly on every code path; the async callable is the cleanest.

---

## 4. a365 CLI 1.1.109 endpoint-registration bug

- **Symptom:** `ERROR: Failed to call create endpoint. Status: BadRequest` with `"errors":{"CallbackUri":["Callback URI is required"],"AgentIdentityBlueprintId":["Agent Identity Blueprint ID is required"]}`
- **Root cause:** The CLI's local debug logs show the values are populated (`Endpoint Name: <your-tunnel>-…`, `Agent Blueprint ID: <YOUR_BLUEPRINT_ID>`), but the JSON it sends to the A365 backend uses old field names (`AppId` instead of `AgentIdentityBlueprintId`, no `CallbackUri` at all). The server-side schema was renamed; the old client wasn't updated.
- **Fix:** Update the CLI:
  ```bash
  dotnet tool update -g Microsoft.Agents.A365.DevTools.Cli
  ```
  Verified working in 1.1.174.
- **Why it matters:** The `a365 setup all` wizard runs to "Setup completed with errors" — easy to miss. Always check the *Failed Steps* block at the end. The CLI even tells you which sub-command to retry: `a365 setup blueprint --endpoint-only`.

---

## 5. a365 CLI 1.1.174 behavioral changes

### 5.1 `--update-endpoint` requires `--m365`

- **Symptom:** `Skipping messaging endpoint update — this command only applies to M365 agents. Pass --m365 to opt in, or configure the endpoint manually in the Teams Developer Portal.`
- **Fix:** Add the flag:
  ```bash
  a365 setup blueprint --m365 --update-endpoint "https://<tunnel>-3978.<region>.devtunnels.ms/api/messages"
  ```
- **Why it matters:** Default behavior changed between 1.1.109 and 1.1.174. Without `--m365`, the command no-ops silently. Spent 5 minutes wondering why "successful" runs didn't actually register anything.

### 5.2 `a365 publish` no longer auto-uploads to Teams

- **Old behavior (≤ 1.1.109):** Pushed straight to Teams Developer Portal.
- **New behavior (1.1.174+):** Generates `manifest/manifest.zip` at the project root using the CLI's own templates, then prints `To publish: https://admin.microsoft.com → Agents → All agents → Upload custom agent`.
- **Implication:** Manual upload via the Microsoft 365 admin center is now the publish step.
- **Gotcha:** The CLI's templates **overwrite** anything you'd customized in `deployment script/manifest/manifest.json`. The new `manifest/manifest.json` (project root) ships with a generic placeholder description. Edit it and re-zip:
  ```bash
  cd manifest
  # edit manifest.json — fix description, accentColor, any other fields
  rm manifest.zip
  zip manifest.zip manifest.json agenticUserTemplateManifest.json color.png outline.png
  ```

---

## 6. Required Microsoft Graph permissions for the custom client app

The `a365 setup` requirements check fails noisily if your custom client app is missing any of these. All six are **delegated** scopes on Microsoft Graph (`00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000`):

| Scope | Well-known ID |
|---|---|
| `User.Read` | `e1fe6dd8-ba31-4d61-89e7-88639da4683d` |
| `Application.ReadWrite.All` | `bdfbf15f-ee85-4955-8675-146e8e5296b5` |
| `AgentIdentityBlueprint.ReadWrite.All` | `4fd490fc-1467-48eb-8a4c-421597ab0402` |
| `AgentIdentityBlueprint.UpdateAuthProperties.All` | `6f677aa9-25af-49a5-8a1d-628dc7f0d009` |
| `DelegatedPermissionGrant.ReadWrite.All` | `41ce6ca6-6826-4807-84f1-1c82854f7ee5` |
| `Directory.Read.All` | `06da0dbc-49e2-44d2-8312-53f166ab848a` |

All require **admin consent**. `deployment script/create_app_registration.ps1` does the lookup-by-name + add + admin-consent automatically, but if admin-consent fails (e.g. you're not Global Admin via CLI), grant it manually in the Entra portal.

---

## 7. Where the agent shows up in the user's UI

- **It does not appear in the Teams app catalog.**
- **It appears in Microsoft 365 Copilot → Agents.**

The agent is registered as an "AI teammate" / agent identity, which lives in the Copilot agents registry, not as a personal-scope Teams bot. URLs:

- https://m365.cloud.microsoft → Copilot icon → **Agents**
- Inside Teams: click **Copilot** in the left rail → **Agents** tab

If your test user can't find it: check the M365 admin center → Agents → your agent → **Activated for** must include them. Default may be empty (only the publishing admin has access).

---

## 8. Bot Framework 502 retry storm during onboarding

- **Symptom:** First few minutes after install in Copilot, your agent log shows ~70 inbound `POST /api/messages` requests, almost all returning 500. Eventually one returns 202 and things settle down.
- **Root cause:** Bot Framework's Skype connector returns 502 Bad Gateway on **outbound** replies during the initial `agentOnboarding` flow. The flow:
  1. Copilot → BF → POST /api/messages (your agent gets the activity)
  2. Your agent processes, calls Foundry, gets a result
  3. Your agent tries to POST the reply to `https://smba.trafficmanager.net/.../activities/...`
  4. **smba.trafficmanager.net returns 502 Bad Gateway** during onboarding
  5. Your agent's reply attempt fails → it returns 500 to BF for the original POST
  6. BF retries the same activity → loop
- **What works:** It self-heals. After ~2 minutes, BF onboarding completes and 502s stop. Subsequent turns succeed in seconds.
- **What it looks like in the wild:** From the user's POV in Copilot: "thinking…" for 1–2 minutes, maybe an error toast, then the response shows up. Resending the prompt usually gets a clean turn.
- **Why it matters:** Easy to mistake the 500-storm for a real bug in your agent. It's not — it's BF infrastructure flakiness during initial agent-identity provisioning.

---

## 9. Manifest path mismatches

### 9.1 `demo-tenant.config.json` lives at the project root, not under `deployment script/`

- The example template (`demo-tenant.config.json.example`) is in `deployment script/`, but `initialize_a365_config.ps1` reads `demo-tenant.config.json` from the **project root**.
- `create_app_registration.ps1` was originally written to write the file under `deployment script/` — fixed to write to the project root. Watch for this if you fork the script.

### 9.2 Two `manifest/` folders that mean different things

- `deployment script/manifest/` — our checked-in template, source-of-truth for description / accent color / app metadata. Edited by hand.
- `manifest/` (project root) — created by `a365 publish`. Uses the CLI's own templates. Overwrites your customizations every run. Treat as build output; you must re-edit and re-zip after each `a365 publish`.

---

## 10. DevTunnel persistence model

- **Tunnel ID + URL are persistent.** Created once with `devtunnel create <name> -a`. Survives reboots, sleeps, network changes. URL is deterministic: `https://<name>-<port>.<region>.devtunnels.ms`. Default expiration is 30 days but auto-extends on use.
- **Host process is NOT persistent.** `devtunnel host <name>` is a foreground process. Closing the terminal, putting the laptop to sleep with no charger, losing Wi-Fi → host process dies → tunnel URL still resolves but returns 502 until you re-run `devtunnel host`.
- **Anonymous access (`-a`) is required.** Bot Framework / M365 Copilot don't carry DevTunnel auth cookies; without `-a`, every request from MS gets a 401 from DevTunnel before it reaches your agent.

---

## 11. OpenAI OTel auto-instrumentation gap (Responses API)

- `opentelemetry-instrumentation-openai-v2==2.4b0` only wraps `openai.resources.chat.completions` (search the package source for `"openai.resources.chat.completions"` — that's the only patched module).
- The Responses API (`openai.resources.responses.responses.AsyncResponses.create`) is **not** patched.
- **Result:** No spans for your `client.responses.create(...)` calls — the auto-instrumentor silently does nothing.
- **Workaround:** A manual span around the call. We do this in `agent.py:process_user_message`, naming the span `draft_dodger.analyse` and setting `gen_ai.*` semantic conventions:
  ```python
  with _tracer.start_as_current_span("draft_dodger.analyse") as span:
      span.set_attribute("gen_ai.system", "azure_openai")
      span.set_attribute("gen_ai.operation.name", "responses")
      span.set_attribute("gen_ai.request.model", deployment)
      ...
      response = await client.responses.create(...)
      span.set_attribute("gen_ai.usage.input_tokens", response.usage.input_tokens)
      ...
  ```
- **Why it matters:** Without the manual span, you have no traces — even though the SDK appears instrumented. Watch the `OpenAIInstrumentor` release notes; once it adds Responses-API support the manual span becomes redundant and can be deleted.

---

## 12. Microsoft Agent 365 observability SDK API

- The `microsoft_agents_a365.observability.core` package exposes a function called `configure(...)`, **not** `setup_observability(...)` (which is what naming intuition suggests, and what some older docs imply).
- Signature roughly:
  ```python
  configure(
      service_name="draft-dodger",
      service_namespace="a365.demo",
      exporter_options=SpectraExporterOptions(endpoint=..., protocol="grpc") | Agent365ExporterOptions(...) | None,
  )
  ```
- **Without exporter options or a token resolver**, the SDK falls back to a **console exporter** that pretty-prints span JSON to stdout. Useful for local dev — you literally see every span in your agent log — but the spans go nowhere persistent.
- For real backends, three options:
  - **A365 first-party telemetry** (the native path, recommended for demos): `Agent365ExporterOptions(token_resolver=<async callable>)`. The token resolver receives `(agent_id, tenant_id)` and must return an agentic-user bearer token for scope `api://9b975845-388f-4429-889e-eab1ef63949c/Agent365.Observability.OtelWrite`. **Critical:** the token resolver must be `async`. The token itself comes from a JWT exchange that happens per turn in `host_agent_server.py:_cache_observability_token` — the exchanged token is stored in the in-memory `token_cache.py` keyed by `(tenant_id, agent_id)`. Spans surface in **admin.microsoft.com → Agents → &lt;agent&gt; → Activity tab**.
  - Local Aspire Dashboard / Jaeger / otelcol → `SpectraExporterOptions(endpoint="http://localhost:4317", protocol="grpc", insecure=True)`.
  - App Insights → not directly supported by `Agent365ExporterOptions`. Wire `AzureMonitorTraceExporter` separately on the tracer provider after `configure()`.
- **Cold-start gotcha (A365 native):** the first turn after agent startup may not export — the token cache is empty until `host_agent_server.py` exchanges and caches the token, which happens inside the turn. The SDK retries on subsequent turns; lost first-turn spans are usually acceptable for demos. If they aren't, prime the cache up front.
- **Idempotent configure:** the SDK logs `a365 observability already configured. Ignoring repeated configure() call.` if `configure()` is called twice. Benign.

---

## 13. AADSTS65001 on `Agent365.Observability.OtelWrite` despite a grant existing

- **Symptom:** With `ENABLE_A365_OBSERVABILITY_EXPORTER=true`, every Copilot turn produces this in the agent log:
  ```
  Failed to acquire agentic user token for agent_app_instance_id <agentic-user>
    and agentic_user_id <user>, {'error': 'invalid_grant',
    'error_description': "AADSTS65001: The user or administrator has not consented
    to use the application with ID '<agentic-user>' named '<agent name>'."}
  ```
  …yet `az rest GET /v1.0/oauth2PermissionGrants` shows a grant *does* exist for `clientId=<agentic-user>`, `resourceId=<A365 Observability SP>`, `scope=" Agent365.Observability.OtelWrite"`, `consentType=AllPrincipals`. So the grant is there, but the token exchange acts as if it isn't.
- **Root cause:** The grant's `scope` field has a **leading space**: `" Agent365.Observability.OtelWrite"` instead of `"Agent365.Observability.OtelWrite"`. The Microsoft Agents SDK's agentic-user authentication uses `grant_type: user_fic` (custom federated-identity-credential flow at `microsoft_agents/authentication/msal/msal_auth.py:396`), which does **strict scope matching** against the persisted grant. Entra normally tolerates whitespace in the space-separated `scope` field, but the `user_fic` flow does not — it surfaces the mismatch as a missing-consent error.
- **Where the leading space comes from:** `a365 setup blueprint` (verified on CLI 1.1.174) emits the inheritable-permission grant with a leading-space-then-scope-name when the grant has only one scope. Looks like a list-join defect.
- **Fix:** PATCH the grant to remove the leading space. One REST call:
  ```bash
  # Look up the grant ID for your tenant
  CLIENT_SP=$(az ad sp list --filter "appId eq '<your-agentic-user-app-id>'" --query '[0].id' -o tsv)
  GRANT_ID=$(az rest --method GET \
    --url "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/oauth2PermissionGrants?\$filter=clientId eq '$CLIENT_SP'" \
    --query 'value[?contains(scope,`Agent365.Observability.OtelWrite`)].id | [0]' -o tsv)

  az rest --method PATCH \
    --url "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/oauth2PermissionGrants/$GRANT_ID" \
    --body '{"scope": "Agent365.Observability.OtelWrite"}' \
    --headers "Content-Type=application/json"
  ```
  Restart the agent. The next Copilot turn should log `✅ Token exchange successful` without an upstream `Failed to acquire agentic user token` line.
- **If PATCH doesn't take, delete + recreate cleanly:**
  ```bash
  az rest --method DELETE --url "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/oauth2PermissionGrants/$GRANT_ID"
  az rest --method POST --url "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/oauth2PermissionGrants" \
    --body "{\"clientId\":\"$CLIENT_SP\",\"resourceId\":\"<A365-Observability-SP-id>\",\"scope\":\"Agent365.Observability.OtelWrite\",\"consentType\":\"AllPrincipals\"}" \
    --headers "Content-Type=application/json"
  ```
- **Why the obvious workarounds fail:**
  - `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant>/v2.0/adminconsent?client_id=<agentic-user>&...` returns **AADSTS500113 — No reply address registered for the application** because the agentic-user app is auto-provisioned by A365 with no redirect URIs. Do not try to add one — modifying the auto-managed app is risky.
  - The M365 admin center → Agents → &lt;agent&gt; → **Permissions** tab does not surface this consent (at least not in the build we tested) — there's nothing actionable there for the OtelWrite scope.
- **Why it matters:** Without this fix, **native A365 observability silently no-ops on every Copilot turn**. Spans are created locally (the `draft_dodger.analyse` span is built fine) but never reach `https://agent365.svc.cloud.microsoft/observability/tenants/.../otlp/agents/.../traces` because the exporter has no bearer token to attach. There is no UI complaint; the Activity tab just stays empty.
- **Diagnostic flag in this repo:** Set `OBSERVABILITY_DEBUG=true` in `.env` and restart the agent. `observability.py:_enable_a365_exporter_debug_logging` will raise the log level on `microsoft_agents_a365.observability` and `microsoft_agents.authentication.msal` so the `AADSTS65001` and the per-export HTTP attempts become visible in the agent log.

---

## 14. Native A365 observability — the *full* bug stack (not just the consent grant)

§13 is one of **four** stacked bugs that all need to be fixed before native A365 observability actually works. They mask each other: the agent looks correct because chat replies still work, the agent log shows no errors at default log level, and the M365 admin center "Activity" tab is silent regardless. You only get spans landing at the A365 ingest endpoint when all four are solved.

### Bug 1 — `oauth2PermissionGrant.scope` has a leading space
See [§13](#13-aadsts65001-on-agent365observabilityotelwrite-despite-a-grant-existing). PATCH it via Graph.

### Bug 2 — `gen_ai.operation.name` must be in `{chat, invoke_agent, execute_tool, output_messages}`

The Agent 365 exporter at `microsoft_agents_a365/observability/core/exporters/utils.py:filter_and_partition_by_identity` drops every span whose `gen_ai.operation.name` isn't in:
```python
GEN_AI_OPERATION_NAMES = frozenset({
    INVOKE_AGENT_OPERATION_NAME,
    EXECUTE_TOOL_OPERATION_NAME,
    OUTPUT_MESSAGES_OPERATION_NAME,
    CHAT_OPERATION_NAME,            # "chat"
    InferenceOperationType.CHAT.value,  # also "chat"
})
```
- **Symptom:** the exporter logs `[Agent365Exporter] N spans without an eligible gen_ai.operation.name filtered out` (DEBUG only) and `No eligible genAI spans to export; nothing exported.` (INFO). At default log level you see neither — **silent drop**.
- **The trap:** the OTel GenAI semantic conventions allow `gen_ai.operation.name = "responses"` for the OpenAI Responses API. The A365 SDK's allowlist *doesn't include it* (despite Foundry returning Responses-shaped output). Setting `"responses"` is the spec-correct choice; setting `"chat"` is the SDK-correct choice. They conflict.
- **Fix:** in `agent.py`'s manual span, set `span.set_attribute("gen_ai.operation.name", "chat")` even when calling the Responses API.

### Bug 3 — `Agent365ExporterOptions.token_resolver` must be **synchronous**

The SDK's type hint claims:
```python
token_resolver: Optional[Callable[[str, str], Awaitable[Optional[str]]]] = None
```
…but the call site at `microsoft_agents_a365/observability/core/exporters/agent365_exporter.py:129` is:
```python
token = self._token_resolver(agent_id, tenant_id)   # no await
```
- **Symptom:** if you write `async def my_resolver(...)`, the SDK calls it without awaiting, gets a coroutine object, and stringifies it directly into the bearer header: `Authorization: Bearer <coroutine object my_resolver at 0x…>`. The A365 ingest endpoint then returns:
  ```
  HTTP 400 — {"code":"EndpointInvalid","message":"Tenant id  is invalid.","innererror":{"code":"TenantIdInvalid"}}
  ```
  Note the **double space** in `"Tenant id  is"` — the server's f-string template has an empty value for the tenant it tried to extract from the malformed bearer.
- **Misleading:** the error says "Tenant id is invalid" — sends you down a `tid`-claim debugging rabbit hole. The token's claims are fine; the bearer string itself is the problem.
- **Fix:** `def my_resolver(...) -> Optional[str]:` (sync). Trust the call site, ignore the type hint.

### Bug 4 — `OBSERVABILITY_DEBUG` needs to lower **both** the namespace logger AND the root logger/handler

The exporter's success path logs only at DEBUG (URL, token resolved, chunk send, HTTP status). With `logging.basicConfig(level=INFO)` (which `agent.py` calls at module load), the root logger AND its handlers are pinned to INFO and silently drop DEBUG records — even if a child namespace logger is set to DEBUG.
- **Fix in `observability.py:_enable_a365_exporter_debug_logging`:**
  ```python
  logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.DEBUG)         # root logger
  for h in logging.getLogger().handlers:
      h.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)                        # root handlers
  for name in ("microsoft_agents_a365.observability",
               "microsoft_agents.authentication.msal"):
      logging.getLogger(name).setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
  ```
- Without this, a successful export looks identical to a silent drop in the agent log: zero output either way. Failures *do* log at ERROR so they're visible — but the absence of DEBUG output makes "did the export actually fire" ambiguous.

### How to test the exporter in isolation (no Copilot turns)

`scripts/test_a365_export.py` lets you iterate on the export path without sending Copilot messages each time. It loads a real OtelWrite token from `/tmp/otelwrite_token.json` (which `observability.py` persists the first time the resolver is called, gated by `OBSERVABILITY_DEBUG=true`) and posts a synthetic span directly to the A365 ingest endpoint. Token is valid for ~1 hour.

```bash
# Start agent with OBSERVABILITY_DEBUG=true, send ONE Copilot turn to populate the token cache,
# then iterate freely:
uv run python scripts/test_a365_export.py
```

Successful export looks like:
```
DEBUG: ... HTTP/1.1 200 OK
DEBUG: HTTP 200 success on attempt 1. Response: {"partialSuccess":{"rejectedSpans":0,"errorMessage":""}}
```

## 15. Demo-day operations

- **The agent's stdout is your demo's best evidence.** Every M365 Copilot turn produces:
  - `INFO:aiohttp.access:127.0.0.1 [...] "POST /api/messages HTTP/1.1" 202 ...` — proves the HTTP request landed
  - A multi-line JSON span block with `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens` / `output_tokens` — proves the Foundry call happened with real token counts
  Tail your agent log in a side terminal during demos. When someone says "is this really running on your laptop?" you point at the log and watch lines appear in real time.
- **Restart procedure for the agent (preserves the tunnel):**
  ```bash
  pkill -f start_with_generic_host
  uv run python start_with_generic_host.py
  ```
  The tunnel is bound to the tunnel ID, not the local agent. A365 doesn't need any reconfiguration.
- **Restart procedure for the dev tunnel host:**
  ```bash
  pkill -f "devtunnel host"
  devtunnel host <your-tunnel-name>
  ```
  URL persists — A365 doesn't notice.
- **Prevent laptop sleep mid-demo (macOS):**
  ```bash
  caffeinate -dimsu
  ```
- **Tunnel host is the brittle bit.** Network changes, accidental Ctrl-C, or laptop suspend kills it. Always have it in its own terminal tab so you can see if it died.

| `400 - api-version query parameter is not allowed when using /v1 path` | §1.3, §2.2 | Don't use `AzureOpenAIResponsesClient`; use raw `openai.AsyncOpenAI`. |
| `400 - Invalid value: ''. Supported values are: 'message', 'reasoning'…` | §2.1 | Bypass `ChatAgent`; call `responses.create` directly. |
| `OpenAIError: Missing credentials` (with `base_url` + token provider set) | §3 | Pass an async callable as `api_key`. |
| `400 - "CallbackUri": ["Callback URI is required"]` | §4 | Update a365 CLI to ≥ 1.1.174. |
| `Skipping messaging endpoint update — this command only applies to M365 agents` | §5.1 | Add `--m365` to `setup blueprint --update-endpoint`. |
| Agent description shows generic placeholder text in M365 admin center | §5.2 | Edit `manifest/manifest.json` after `a365 publish`, re-zip. |
| `[CLIENT_APP_VALIDATION_FAILED] Client app is missing required API permissions` | §6 | Run `create_app_registration.ps1 -Force` (adds all six Graph perms + admin consent). |
| Agent doesn't appear in Teams app catalog | §7 | Look in M365 Copilot → Agents instead. Also check "Activated for" in admin center. |
| Lots of 500s on `POST /api/messages` right after install | §8 | BF onboarding 502 storm — self-heals in ~2 min. |
| `ERROR: demo-tenant.config.json not found` | §9.1 | The actual file lives at project root, not under `deployment script/`. |
| No spans appearing despite `OpenAIInstrumentor().instrument()` | §11 | Auto-instrumentor doesn't cover Responses API. Use a manual span. |
| `setup_observability` import fails | §12 | The function is named `configure(...)`. |
| `AADSTS65001 — user or administrator has not consented` on every Copilot turn (with `ENABLE_A365_OBSERVABILITY_EXPORTER=true`) | §13 | The `oauth2PermissionGrant` for OtelWrite has a leading space in `scope`. PATCH it to remove the space. |
| `AADSTS500113 — No reply address registered` when opening admin-consent URL | §13 | The agentic-user app has no redirect URIs and you can't safely add one. Fix the grant via Graph API instead. |
| `[Agent365Exporter] N spans without an eligible gen_ai.operation.name filtered out` (or *no* exporter activity at all in the log despite `is_agent365_exporter_enabled()=True`) | §14 Bug 2 | Set `gen_ai.operation.name = "chat"` on the span, not `"responses"`. SDK allowlist excludes the Responses-API operation name. |
| `HTTP 400 — {"code":"EndpointInvalid","message":"Tenant id  is invalid.","innererror":{"code":"TenantIdInvalid"}}` (note the double space in the message) | §14 Bug 3 | Your `token_resolver` is `async def`. SDK calls it without `await`, ships a coroutine repr as the bearer. Make it `def`. |
| Spans seem to be created but no exporter logs at all in the agent log | §14 Bug 4 | `logging.basicConfig(level=INFO)` filters DEBUG everywhere. Set `OBSERVABILITY_DEBUG=true` and ensure `observability.py` lowers root + handlers + namespace levels. |
